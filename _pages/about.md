I am currently in my fifth year pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. Under the guidance of Prof. Dinesh Manocha, I specialize in tackling challenges related to multi-agent navigation within complex environments.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a bachelor's degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I interned for a summer at McMaster University, Canada, with Prof. Gray Bone, where I was involved in the development of an autonomous collaborative robotic arm.
