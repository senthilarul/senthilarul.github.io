I am currently the Motion Planning Lead at <a href="https://alpha-z.ai/">AlphaZ</a>. I recently defended my Ph.D. in <a href="https://ece.umd.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Dinesh Manocha</a>. My research integrates robotics, motion planning, and reinforcement learning to advance AI technology, with a focus on <strong>multi-robot coordination, navigation, and social navigation</strong>. Specifically, I specialize in cooperative navigation and motion planning under uncertainty, exploring innovative solutions for real-world applications. In addition, I completed two internships at <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/">Amazon Lab126</a>, specifically with the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/devices-services/consumer-robotics">Consumer Robotics group</a>. Currently, I am interning with <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/-/motion-planning-and-interactive-decision-making?redirect=%2F">Honda Research Institute (HRI)</a> for Spring 2025, where I am working on interactive motion planning and decision-making in the context of autonomous vehicles.
<br><br>

I hold a bachelor's degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I interned for a summer at McMaster University, Canada, with <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/mech/faculty/dr-gary-m-bone/">Prof. Gray Bone</a>, 
where I was involved in the development of an autonomous collaborative robotic arm.
I am proficient in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, with a strong publication record in <br> top-tier robotics and AI conferences.
