I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, specializing in multi-agent navigation within complex environments under the guidance of Prof. Dinesh Manocha. My research integrates robotics, motion planning, and reinforcement learning to advance AI technology.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Instrumentation and Control Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. I interned for a summer at McMaster University, Canada, with Prof. Gray Bone, where I was involved in the development of an autonomous collaborative robotic arm. I am proficient in C++, Python, and TensorFlow, with a strong publication record in top-tier robotics and AI conferences.
