     - title: Applied Scientist Intern
       institution: Amazon Lab126
       year: Summer'23
       description: Project: Zero-Shot Object Goal Navigation
         - Developed a hybrid approach integrating foundational models (esp. Visual Language Models (VLM)) with conventional
           model-based methods to achieve autonomous object goal navigation for ground robots.

     - title: Applied Scientist Intern
       institution: Amazon Lab126
       year: Summer'22
       description: Project: Reducing Robot Freezing Behavior
         - Explored cost formulations to mitigate the robot freezing issue for a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based trajectory planner, 
           enhancing navigation behavior in probabilistic scenarios.
         - Demonstrated that the developed cost formulation complies with stability and safety definitions commonly associated with control barrier functions.

     - title: Research Intern
       institution: McMaster University, Canada
       year: Summer 2016
       description: Software Development for Autonomous Collaborative Robotic Arm
         - Successfully implemented a model based collision avoidance for a CRS F3 robotic arm using point cloud data from Microsoft Kinect.
         - Implemented a vision-based modeling and grasping software to autonomously identify the object in the workspace, model the object in 3D, 
           and compute the end-effector orientation for an effective grasp.
